# Nexus in Proton

Set env variables:
```sh
export STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata
export STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH=~/.steam/steam
```

Then we can execute programs directly using proton with:
```sh
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton\ -\ Experimental/proton run path/to/executable.exe
```
